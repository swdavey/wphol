## Introduction
We have now a highly available and read-scalable Wordpress website.  
It's now time to improve our backup by enabling PITR: we want to preserve our transactions!

1. In the OCI console navigate to your database instance as before (i.e. from the Hamburger menu, select Databases, then under MySQL select DB Systems. If you cannot see your database then check that you are in the correct compartment).

### This ends our workshop.
Please remember that tenancy costs are calculated on running instances and space used.
Shutdown the instances when you don't need them or use the stack to easily [destroy](./destroy.md) the infrastructure created in this workshop.
